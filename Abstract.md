Abstract
Ising model : classical and quantum mechanical perspective

Presentation Scheduled on November 9, 2022

In this project I studied the Ising model analytically and numerically using metropolis algorithm. I studied various statistical and thermodynamical properties such as phase trasition, heat capacity, susceptibility, critical exponents etc. Then I worked on Quantum Ising model studying the quantum phase transitions and critical points. I also simulated one dimensional transverse field ising model in QISKIT and computed the expectation value of transverse magnetization and time evolution. Atlast, I explored the applications of these models in many body physics.
